# Bank-Churners-Data-Analysis
Looking at the dataset containing information about bank customers to find if there are any common features between atritted customers. 

The libraries used for this project are pandas, sns, matplotlib.plt. I'm trying to find out if we can read anything from the features of churned customers to retain others.

Some of the features analysed are: age, marital status, educational backgroud, income, and credit card category.
Here are some graphs generated in the project:

We can clearly see that amongst many features given in the dataset, the card category plays important role. It may be a hint for the management to improve the offer for Blue Card customers.
